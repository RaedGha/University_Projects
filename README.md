# University Projects
Here are all the projects that I did at the university 

### Artificial Intelligence and its Services to Humanity
This project was made for a technical writing skills course, which was a group of five students. The task was creating a professional report about a technical topic. Our topic was how artificial intelligence helps us to facilitate our lives.

### OOP STORE
This project was made for an object-oriented programming I course, where we applied the concepts of classes and objects for the first time. It was a group project of two students. The idea was to simulate an online shop that sells some products (clothes, smartphones, books, and laptops). We used CSV files to read the products and write the information about the customer's cart.
